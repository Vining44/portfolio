           We Are All Stuck in Some Metaphorical Cave At Some Point in Our Lives, But We Can All Strive to See The Truth About Our Misguidance. 
           Most of us Are Raised "Looking at The Wall," But Once We Leave Home We Then See That Life is Not All That We've Been Taught. We Must Yearn For Knowledge so That We Not be Consumed by The Darkness That is Naivety.
