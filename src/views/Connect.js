                        I'm a loner, but I'm not alone.
                        I'm a roamer who has a home.
                        I think a lot, but my mind's at ease.
                        You can call me a ponderer if you please.
                        I spread the love, for that I am proud.
                        I'm not too quiet, nor too loud.
                        I'm not just an average joe you see,
                        But not yet the best that I can be.
                        I'll keep on pushing everyday,
                        for I know one day I'll find my way. ~KMJV~

                        Some say the world will end in fire,
                        Some say in ice.
                        From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
                        I hold with those who favor fire.
                        But if it had to perish twice,
                        I think I know enough of hate
                        To say that for destruction ice
                        Is also great
                        And would suffice.

                        We cannot fully appreciate the light without the shadows. 
                        We have to be thrown off balance to find our footing. 
                        It's better to jump than fall. 
                        And here I am.
